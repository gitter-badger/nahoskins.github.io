{"name":"Code Tuna","tagline":"Teaching Code to Bermudas Kids","body":"### Bermuda: Experimental Capital of the World\r\nIt's common place to hear of the impact the downturn in the economy has had on the job market in Bermuda. Politicians throw the issue at each other like a desperate game of Hot Potato, trying to show that whilst they haven't fixed the problem, they've certainly wasted enough time throwing words and promises into the breeze to warrant a reelection.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is unfair, the problem is not a simple one, there are many factors at work (and people not) which contribute to the lethargy in the market today. You could (and some do) discuss this for hours without really achieving anything. Too often the conversation crumbles into a slew of missunderstood economic theory and political parroting picked up from the Radio Talk Show of the hour.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I believe we can all agree on: Employability is directly correlated to Education.\r\nThe logic, simply being that if one is empowered with the ability to execute a task well, there are people who will invest resources in exchange for their time and ability.\r\n\r\nSo what is the state of Bermuda's Education System?\r\nIn a word: *bipolar*.\r\n\r\nThe Public vs Private war has been waged on many fronts and it is a sad fact of mathematics that institutions driven by profit as a motivator do better than the alternative.\r\n\r\nIt needn't **reamin** a *sad* fact.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to craft Businesses so that whilst they create value for themselves, they create equal or greater value in the lives of their customers/employees.\r\n\r\nTypically the method of value craftsmanship is radically different between those two parties. Customers on one hand exchange resources for goods/services. The Employees exchange time for resources. The Business facilitates this transaction by directing the time and producing the goods/services.\r\n\r\nIt's my belief that Bermuda, our island home, is the perfect experimental environment. I believe with the right people at the helm, this Island could turn into the epicenter of a movement that shakes the foundations of what define:Country returns in google.\r\n\r\nWhy is this?\r\n\r\nBermuda is small. Tiny. 21 square miles of estate, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We have a population that hovers below that of most Towns in other States. Our small size imposes strict limitations on us, forces us to import most of our goods, which drives the cost of everything into the roof. It also forces us to consider our population with greater skepticism. How many human bodies can 21 square miles comfortably hold anyway!?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
